				Code-splitting your app can help you “lazy-load” just the things that are currently needed by the user,
				which can dramatically improve the performance of your app. While you haven’t reduced the overall amount
				of code in your app, you’ve avoided loading code that the user may never need, and reduced the amount of
				code needed during the initial load.
