# Transfer List (Liste de transfert)

<p class="description">A transfer list (or "shuttle") enables the user to move one or more list items between lists.</p>

## Simple Transfer List

For completeness, this example includes buttons for "move all", but not every transfer list needs these.

## Enhanced Transfer List

This example exchanges the "move all" buttons for a "select all / select none" checkbox, and adds a counter.
