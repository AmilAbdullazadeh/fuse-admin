# Grid List

<p class="description">Grid lists display a collection of images in an organized grid.</p>

[Grid lists](https://material.io/design/components/image-lists.html) represent a collection of items in a repeated pattern. They help improve the visual comprehension of the content they hold.

## Image-only Grid list

A simple example of a scrollable image `GridList`.

{{"demo": "pages/components/grid-list/ImageGridList.js", "hideEditButton": true}}

## Grid list with titlebars

This example demonstrates the use of the `GridListTileBar` to add an overlay to each `GridListTile`.
The overlay can accommodate a `title`, `subtitle` and secondary action - in this example an `IconButton`.

{{"demo": "pages/components/grid-list/TitlebarGridList.js", "hideEditButton": true}}

## Single line Grid list

This example demonstrates a horizontal scrollable single-line grid list of images.
Horizontally scrolling grid lists are discouraged because the scrolling interferes with typical reading patterns, affecting comprehension.
One notable exception is a horizontally-scrolling, single-line grid list of images, such as a gallery.

{{"demo": "pages/components/grid-list/SingleLineGridList.js", "hideEditButton": true}}

## Advanced Grid list

This example demonstrates "featured" tiles, using the `rows` and `cols` props to adjust the size of the tile, and the `padding` prop to adjust the spacing.
The tiles have a customized titlebar, positioned at the top and with a custom gradient `titleBackground`.
The secondary action `IconButton` is positioned on the left.
