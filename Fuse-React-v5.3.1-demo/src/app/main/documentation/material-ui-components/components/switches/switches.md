# Switch

<p class="description">Switches toggle the state of a single setting on or off.</p>

[Switches](https://material.io/design/components/selection-controls.html#switches) are the preferred way to adjust settings on mobile.
The option that the switch controls, as well as the state itâ€™s in,
should be made clear from the corresponding inline label.

## Basic switches

{{"demo": "pages/components/switches/Switches.js"}}

## Switch with FormControlLabel

`Switch` can be provided with a description thanks to the `FormControlLabel` component.

{{"demo": "pages/components/switches/SwitchLabels.js"}}

## Switches with FormGroup

`FormGroup` is a helpful wrapper used to group selection controls components that provides an easier API.
However, you are encouraged you to use [Checkboxes](/components/checkboxes/) instead if multiple related controls are required. (See: [When to use](#when-to-use)).

{{"demo": "pages/components/switches/SwitchesGroup.js"}}

## Customized switches

Here are some examples of customizing the component. You can learn more about this in the
[overrides documentation page](/customization/components/).

## Sizes

Fancy smaller switches? Use the `size` property.

## Label placement

You can change the placement of the label:

## When to use

- [Checkboxes vs. Switches](https://uxplanet.org/checkbox-vs-toggle-switch-7fc6e83f10b8)

## Accessibility

- It will render an element with the `checkbox` role not `switch` role since this
  role isn't widely supported yet. Please test first if assistive technology of your
  target audience supports this role properly. Then you can change the role with
  `<Switch inputProps={{ role: 'switch' }}>`
- All form controls should have labels, and this includes radio buttons, checkboxes, and switches. In most cases, this is done by using the `<label>` element ([FormControlLabel](/api/form-control-label/)).
- When a label can't be used, it's necessary to add an attribute directly to the input component.
  In this case, you can apply the additional attribute (e.g. `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`, `title`) via the `inputProps` property.

```jsx
<Switch value="checkedA" inputProps={{ 'aria-label': 'Switch A' }} />
```
