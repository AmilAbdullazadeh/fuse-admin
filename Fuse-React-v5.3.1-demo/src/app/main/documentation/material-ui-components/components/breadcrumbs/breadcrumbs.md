## Accessibility

(WAI-ARIA: https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#breadcrumb)

Be sure to add a `aria-label` description on the `Breadcrumbs` component.

The accessibility of this component relies on:

- The set of links is structured using an ordered list (`<ol>` element).
- To prevent screen reader announcement of the visual separators between links, they are hidden with `aria-hidden`.
- A nav element labeled with `aria-label` identifies the structure as a breadcrumb trail and makes it a navigation landmark so that it is easy to locate.
