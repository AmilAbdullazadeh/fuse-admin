				Fuse React isnâ€™t an end product or an extension so there is no easy way to update the project. Due to
				the nature of apps, we cannot give any set instructions for updating Fuse React. It heavily depends on
				your project and it's up to you to update your code. However, there are a couple points that we want to
				put forward which might help you to keep Fuse React updated:
			</Typography>

			<Typography className="my-16" component="div">
				<ol>
					<li className="mb-16">
						The most important one is not to touch the /@fuse directory but sometimes that is going to be
						inevitable and in those cases, try to keep the modifications minimal.
					</li>
					<li className="mb-16">
						Usually React and Material UI libraries do some breaking changes and force our hands to change
						things. In those cases, it's always good to check their official Changelogs to see what they
						did. Usually they provide clear instructions and even helper tools to update your code.
					</li>
					<li className="mb-16">
						Before starting your new project,{' '}
						<a href="http://support.withinpixels.com/github" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
							join our Github repo
						</a>
						, fork it and build your app on top of that fork. This way, in the future, you can easily merge
						or compare the changes from the main repo onto your fork. This will require merging a lot of
						changes manually, but it's the best way to keep the Fuse React updated.
					</li>
				</ol>
